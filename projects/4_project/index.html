I spent a semester in culinary school before starting my PhD and I love trying new restaurants when I travel. Recently, my partner and I have been researching food spots to try for an upcoming trip, and it made me wonder what cities have the best-reviewed food, but also, are people in some parts of the world a little more circumspect with their reviews? Is it posisble reviewers in Chicago (Where I live) are just more generous in their reviews than in New York? or London?</p> <p>I decided to take a look at the average restaurant reviews on Yelp for different cities. To do this, I scraped data from Yelp and then took the average review across the top 100 most reviewed restaurants in each city and added them to a map using ArcGIS.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/restaurants-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/restaurants-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/restaurants-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/restaurants.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Average restaurant reviews by city.
