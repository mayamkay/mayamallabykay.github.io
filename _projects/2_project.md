<em> Skills: Google Colab, GitHub, Python </em>

Early on in my PhD, I spent time developing a set of Jupyter Notebooks that would help other scientists analyze data from my collaborations telescope (see <a href="https://mayamkay.github.io/projects/1_project/">this project</a>). We got some really incredible feedback from that work and so for ACT's Data Release 6 we decided to release notebooks once again to help the community use our data. This time, I helped coordinate our efforts, and we decided to pivot to using Google Colab notebooks, a phenomenal way of sharing code with the wider community. 

I would like to highlight that much of the actual code in these notebooks was written by other students, and what I'm highlighting here is very much a collaborative effort. I am incredibly proud of the work done by many of the authors of these notebooks!
