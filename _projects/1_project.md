title: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope - Data Access for the Data Releases 4 and 5 
description: In order to facilitate ease of access to the data presented as part of these data releases, I led a project to develop a set of Jupyter IPython notebooks designed to introduce users to DR4 and DR5 and the tools needed to analyze these data.

During my PhD I worked with an incredible collaboration called the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (or ACT). ACT was also a telescope that was located in the Atacama desert in Chile that my collaboration used to produce maps of the sky, and specifically of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This project showcases some of the data accessibility work I did with the ACT collaboration to teach other scientists how to use our data products. 

As part of this project, we published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03154">paper</a> and a set of <a href="https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR4_DR5_Notebooks"> Jupyter Notebooks </a>.
