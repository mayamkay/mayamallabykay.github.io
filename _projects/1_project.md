            During my PhD I worked with an incredible collaboration called the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (or ACT). ACT was also a telescope that was located in the Atacama desert in Chile that my collaboration used to produce maps of the sky, and specifically of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This project showcases some of the data accessibility work I did with the ACT collaboration to teach other scientists how to use our data products.

            As part of this project, we published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03154">paper</a> and a set of <a href="https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR4_DR5_Notebooks"> Jupyter Notebooks </a>.

            The notebooks walk users through a range of different analyses, including how users can make maps of interesting astrophysical structures like this one!
