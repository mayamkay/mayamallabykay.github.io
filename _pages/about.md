I'm Maya, a data scientist and researcher with a PhD in astrophysics and a passion for applying data science to environmental problems.

As a researcher at the University of Chicago, I lead multiple research projects that focus on analyzing large data sets from a variety of telescopes, including my own collaboration's telescope, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. My research includes measuring signals in noisy maps of the sky using scipy, pandas, and JAX and comparing these measurements to physically motivated models. I have also developed machine learning models in JAX that allow us to simulate maps of our observable universe at specific frequencies. These projects involve analyzing complex, and often messy or incomplete, datasets and developing new approaches to address problems in my field. 

Before starting my PhD, I studied pastry at Le Cordon Bleu, and I still love to bake in my free time. I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing, although Chicago is admittedly a little on the flat side!
