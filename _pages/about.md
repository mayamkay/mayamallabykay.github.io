I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago studying Astronomy and Astrophysics. Over the years my work has focused on leveraging large data sets from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloane Digital Sky Survey to learn about the morphology of distant galaxy clusters.

From a technical stand point I have extensive experience working in python and reguraly use packages such as pandas, scipy, jax and scikit-learn. I generally work with computer clusters and am comfortable writing and optimizing code for projects using big data sets.

Finally outside of research I'm passionate about data accesibility and have worked to make data from my collaboration (the Atacama Cosmology Telescope) not only public but easy to use and understand. I've done so by working with a team of scientists to develop accesibly jupyter notebooks that guide users through common analyses.
