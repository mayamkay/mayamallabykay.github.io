I'm Maya, a data scientist and researcher with a PhD in astrophysics and a passion for applying data science to environmental problems.

As a researcher at the University of Chicago, I led multiple research projects that focused on analyzing large data sets from a variety of telescopes, including my own collaboration's telescope, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. My research includes measuring signals in noisy maps of the sky using scipy, pandas, and JAX and comparing these measurements to physically motivated models. I have also developed machine learning models in JAX that allow us to simulate maps of our observable universe at specific frequencies. These projects involve analyzing complex, and often messy or incomplete, datasets and developing new approaches to address problems in my field. 

As I transition out of academia, I look forward to using these data science skills in a climate-focused organization. I am interested in using geospatial data from satellites to further our understanding of our earth. From a technical standpoint, I enjoy developing machine learning models and working with large datasets to answer nuanced questions. My expertise lies primarily in Python, and I have a strong background with many of the classic data science libraries, including pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. I have additional experience with GIS technologies and SQL and enjoy expanding my skill set and learning new techniques.

Before starting my PhD, I studied pastry at Le Cordon Bleu, and I still love to bake in my free time. I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing, although Chicago is admittedly a little on the flat side!
