I am a <a href='#'>PhD candidate at the University of Chicago</a> studying Astronomy and Astrophysics. During my PhD I have used a range of data science techniques to study astrophysical data in order to learn about distant galaxy clusters. As I wrap up my PhD I'm looking to use the skills I've learned in my degree in a career in the <a href='#'>climate and sustainability space</a>.
 
From a technical standpoint I have extensive experience working in <a href='#'>python</a> and regularly use packages such as <a href='#'>pandas, scipy, jax and scikit-learn</a>. I generally work with computer clusters and am comfortable writing and optimizing code for projects using big data sets.

I'm also passionate about <a href='#'>data accessibility</a> and have worked to make data from my collaboration (the Atacama Cosmology Telescope) not only public but easy to use and understand. I've done so by working with a team of scientists to develop accessible <a href='https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/DR4_DR5_Notebooks/tree/master'>jupyter notebooks</a> that guide users through common analyses.

Before starting my PhD, I studied pastry at Le Cordon Bleu, and I still love to bake in my free time. I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing, although Chicago is admittedly a little on the flat side!
