description: I am a PhD student studying Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. My experience includes studying the gas properties of distant galaxy clusters using CMB data combined with optical data, working with large scale simulations to understand the bejaivour of gas around galaxy clusters and developing jupyter notebooks that can be used by scientists outside of my field to study data produced by my collaboration.
